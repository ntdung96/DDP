# The interval overlapping simulation

In my senior year at college of 2018, I had a privilege to work with professor Ordower, head of the Math department at my college, in a private 1-credit class. He gave me a math problem, which I now don't remember the problem exactly. I could not find an answer and proof to the problem, but I came up with the idea of using the computer to estimating the answer just the night before I met him. I spent the night to reword the math problem into a "programming" question and wrote simulation in R to show him. The answer to that problem is that the probability of at least 1 line that overlaps all other lines in the 0 to 1 range is 2/3. Anyway, we both liked the program a lot and we think it was great.

This is the version of that script, which is only closed to the original code I showed him. The question itself was written up from my memory so it is not the question I received. The final draft I could still keep is in this repository (including a script that used a parallel computing technique): https://github.com/ntdung96/probability

#### => The Shiny app developed for this simulation is available at: https://ntdung96.shinyapps.io/Interval/ 

#### I wrote a small presentation for this application and published to RPubs: https://rpubs.com/ntdung96/684704

#### The source codes of ui.R and server.R are available on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/ntdung96/DDP
